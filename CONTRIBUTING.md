## Current Policy: Closed to External Contributions

This is a personal hobby project maintained in spare time for the author's own experimentation and enjoyment.
To preserve that low‑pressure scope, **external code contributions (PRs), feature requests, and enhancement issues are
not being accepted**.

### Rationale
* I don't want to spend free time on code review, triage, or negotiations about scope.
* A tightly controlled change stream keeps the internals lean and performance predictable.
* The API is still evolving; external churn would slow iteration.

### What You Can Still Do
* Report clear, reproducible bugs or security concerns (minimal example, Python version, expected vs actual). Response
	time may vary or be absent if it doesn't align with current focus.
* Open a short “use‑case” issue if you think a scenario is interesting. No guarantees it will be acted on.

### Not Accepted (Will Be Closed)
* Pull requests of any kind (features, refactors, style changes, dependency bumps).
* Feature / enhancement issues framed as requests rather than informational.
* Broad “idea” threads without a concrete minimal example.

### Security
If you suspect a genuine security issue, file a concise issue without sensitive data. It will be prioritized above
general bugs when possible.

### Future Revisit
The policy may be revisited if the project stabilizes and maintainer bandwidth changes—but you should assume it stays
closed.

Thanks for respecting the boundaries and for your interest in this project.
